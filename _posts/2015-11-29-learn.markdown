    ownWHOIS is a self-hosted WHOIS solution. It's built around the node.js module node-whois. In a nutshell, ownWhois is an express wrapper for the node-whois module.

    The core of ownWHOIS is the RESTful API [ownhois-rest-api](). By running this program you create a personal and self-hosted WHOIS REST API.

    ownWHOIS is still under development, meaning there are still things missing. You can help out by submitting code or issues to our Github.

    Before you start off creating your own WHOIS service, check out the [documentation]('/docs') for reference.

    The cool thing about having a seperate API is the possibility for external clients. The HTML5 client is currently under development.
