    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>ownWHOIS is a self-hosted WHOIS solution. It's built around the node.js module node-whois. In a nutshell, ownWhois is an express wrapper for the node-whois module.</p>

    <p>The core of ownWHOIS is the RESTful API [ownhois-rest-api](). By running this program you create a personal and self-hosted WHOIS REST API. </p>

    <p>ownWHOIS is still under development, meaning there are still things missing. You can help out by submitting code or issues to our Github.</p>

    <p>Before you start off creating your own WHOIS service, check out the [documentation]('/docs') for reference.</p>

    <p>The cool thing about having a seperate API is the possibility for external clients. The HTML5 client is currently under development. </p>
